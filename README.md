<p>
-Back in Azure, type "Resource groups" in the search and delete the Resource Group created at the beginning of this lab (if you see a second one, delete it too). Your VMs will be deleted subsequently because they are part of the Resource Group.

-Verify Resource Groups deletion to ensure that no resources are left behind, preventing unnecessary costs and resource consumption. 




<h2>End-User Ticketing & Helpdesk Resolution process in now complete!</h2>

<b>We've successfully gone through the life cycle of a ticket from creation to resolution, made changes to the tickets when necessary like assigning the tickets, changing the SLA (Service Level Agreement), commenting to create a thread of clear communication, as well as practicing with different ticket scenarios.</b>
