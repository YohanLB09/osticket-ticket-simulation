<h2>End-User Ticketing & Helpdesk Resolution process in now complete!</h2>

<b>We've successfully gone through the life cycle of a ticket from creation to resolution, made changes to the tickets when necessary like assigning the tickets, changing the SLA (Service Level Agreement), commenting to create a thread of clear communication, as well as practicing with different ticket scenarios.</b>
